# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This repository was created as part of the [Tools for Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science), which is a component of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). The primary purpose of this repository is to fulfill an assignment requirement for the course.

In this assignment, we have created a Jupyter Notebook that lists popular data science languages, libraries, and open source development environment tools.
